         <h1>Birds</h1>
         <p id="p1">The vast majority of bird species have the ability to fly, a skill made possible through the evolution of wings, feathers and a number of other adaptations. A number of birds however, such as penguins and ostriches, have lost the ability
          to fly due to evolving in an environment where flying wasn’t necessary.</p>

       <div id="div2" title="About Birds">
        <h1>Parrot</h1>
        <p id="p2">Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and u
          ndomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, a
          nd feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets.</p>

        <h1>Birds Biography</h1>
        <p id="p3">Feathers not only act as insulation, but also allow for flight, enabling the lift and thrust necessary to become airborne. The feathers on a wing are flexible, so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them, reducing the drag on the wing. Flight feathers are asymmetrical, which affects airflow over them and provides some of the lifting and thrusting force required for flight. Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings: primary feathers and secondary feathers. Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust. Secondary feathers are located closer to the body, attach to the forearm portion of the wing, and provide lift. Contour feathers are those found on the body. They help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight, creating a smooth, aerodynamic surface allowing air to flow smoothly 
        over the bird’s body for efficient flight.</p>
