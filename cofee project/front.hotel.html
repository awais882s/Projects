    Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug that keeps people awake. To make a drink from coffee beans, the beans must first be specially prepared by drying the beans and then roasting. The beans are dried a short time after they are picked.
     This preserves them and makes them ready to be packed or roasted.

<p>Have you ever wondered why I love coffee so much? Like, how is it even possible to love coffee so much? Well, there are many reasons why I love coffee and today, I’m letting you in on just seven of them</p>

   <h2 class="product_heading">Coffee 2</h2>
   <p>I love how primitive brewing a cup of coffee is. The process involves pouring hot water over some crushed up beans. That’s it. No chemicals or preservatives, no ingredients or nutritional information to double-check. It’s just coffee, plain and simple.</p>

           <p>I love that coffee has well-documented health benefits. Seriously, I’d have a real long-term health problem on my hands if I felt this strongly about alcohol, drugs or cigarettes</p>
